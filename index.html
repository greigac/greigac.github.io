                        I started gaining an interest in technology at around the age of 13 where I started developing websites back in the days of Geocities where I created several sites and configuring message boards based off other hobbies of mine. 
                        I continued to study the ins and outs of how a pc functioned before deciding that computing was something I wanted to pursue as a career. I went on to attend the University of the Highlands and Islands where I completed my Bachelor of Science Honors Degree in Computing.

                    <br>
                        Throughout university I have learned a wide range of languages such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP while working with databases such as MySQL. I also learned the fundamentals of computers and network server management. I mainly worked on front-end development with a touch of back-end.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Since graduating I’ve continued to improve my skills and keep up to date with technology while learning new frameworks and languages. A portfolio that has several pieces of my work can be found on my github: <a href="https://github.com/greigac">https://github.com/greigac</a> I am currently seeking to find work where I can put what I have learned to use.

                Currently helping with any technical support that the lecturer and students need. This can range 
                from laptop issues, how to use and configure settings in a laptop, how to use Microsoft products 
                like Word and Excel along with printer issues and navigating the College’s setup. Patience and 
                understanding is required due to students not being fluent in English.

            <p>
                I helped volunteer for an ESOL course as part of the Connect course. The instructor would ask me to 
                help out her students with any English problems they have and computer problems since they are computer 
                literate. I learned a lot on how an ESOL course runs and because I did well on my time there, the instructor 
                is happy to have me back when the course restarts.
